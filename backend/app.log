## Overview of the Issue

Rape cases in Pakistan have been a significant concern in recent years. According to the Sustainable Social Development Organization, there were 7,010 rape cases reported in Pakistan in 2023, with almost 95% of them occurring in Punjab. However, due to social stigmas that discourage women from seeking help, the actual number of cases may be even higher.

## Recent Case in Islamabad

A recent rape case in Pakistan's capital, Islamabad, sparked massive protests but the uproar soon hushed down. Fury is hard to maintain, and developments in the case are nothing short of a challenge.

## Police Response and Student Protests

In a recent incident, police fired tear gas to disperse students protesting over an alleged on-campus rape in Punjab, in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, on October 17, 2024. This incident highlights the ongoing struggle for justice and the need for better law enforcement and societal support for victims of rape.

## Legal Framework

In Pakistan, rape is considered a criminal offense under the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). **Section 375** of the PPC defines rape as "the act of a man having sexual intercourse with a woman under circumstances falling under any of the five following descriptions: First, against her will. Secondly, without her consent. Thirdly, with her consent, when her consent has been obtained by putting her or any person in whom she is interested in fear of death or of hurt. Fourthly, with her consent, when the man knows that he is not her husband, and that her consent is given because she believes that he is another man to whom she is or believes herself to be lawfully married. Fifthly, with or without her consent, when she is under sixteen years of age."

## Challenges and Future Directions

Despite the legal framework, rape cases in Pakistan face several challenges, including underreporting, lack of societal support, and inadequate law enforcement. To address these issues, there is a need for better awareness campaigns, improved law enforcement strategies, and stronger support systems for victims of rape.
